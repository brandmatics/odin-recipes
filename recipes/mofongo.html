     <h2>Description</h2>
     
     <p>Plantain mofongo is thought to originate in <em>Puerto Rico<em>, and is a dish made from fried green (unripe) plantains mashed together with garlic and crackling pork rinds, also known as chicharr√≥n. To make mofongo, the plantains are sliced and fried until tender, and then mashed with garlic paste and pork cracklings. The mixture can either be formed into balls or a half-dome shape. Mofongo is traditionally mashed in a mortar and pestle, but you can use a potato masher if you don't have one.</p>

     <h2>Ingredients</h2>

     <ul>
          <li>3 Medium Green Plantains</li>
          <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
          <li>1 Tablespoon of Garlic Paste</li>
          <li>6 Ounces of Pork Rinds or Cracklings, crushed</li>
          <li>Kosher Salt, to taste</li>
         
     </ul>

     <h2>Steps</h2>

     <ol>
          <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
          <li>Heat about 2 inches of oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet or deep fryer to 350 F.</li>
          <li>While the oil is heating up, peel the plantains and cut into 1-inch rounds.</li>
          <li>Fry the plantains until golden and tender, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
          <li>Remove cooked plantains from the pan or fryer to a paper-towel-lined plate.</li>
          <li>Put the garlic paste in a large bowl or mortar and add the fried plantains, in batches, if necessary. Mash thoroughly.</li>
          <li>Add the pork rinds. Continue to mash and mix until all of the ingredients are combined. Add salt to taste.</li>
          <li>Shape the mofongo into 4 balls and serve.</li>
          <li>Alternatively, you can make the mofongo into a half-dome shape using a small condiment bowl as a mold; push a portion of mofongo down to the bottom of the bowl.</li>
          <li>With the back of a spoon, smooth over and level off the mix.</li>
          <li>Then use the spoon to scrape around the bowl and remove the mash in a half-dome shape.</li>
     </ol>
